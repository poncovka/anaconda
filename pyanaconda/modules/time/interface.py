    Specify a list of NTP servers to be used (comma-separated list with no spaces). The chrony package is automatically installed when this option is used. If you donâ€™t want the package to be automatically installed then use -chrony in package selection. For example:

    ``timezone --ntpservers=ntp.cesnet.cz,tik.nic.cz Europe/Prague``

     Sets the system time zone to timezone. To view a list of available time zones, use the timedatectl list-timezones command.
